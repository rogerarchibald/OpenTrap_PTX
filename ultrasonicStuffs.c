 There is already a lot happening in Timers and so I'll put everything here that's specific to the Ultrasonic RangeFinder.  The Flow is as follows:

    - At the start of Main.c prior to the infinite loop, I'll call prep4Fire which will set up Timer1 to be ready to go.
    
    - 25mS into my 50mS loop, timers.c will call 'enableNoise' which will enable the ouptut and turn on the timer, pulsing the Xducer for ~200uS.  After it's done pulsing, I'll call 'kickTheCan(25) which will give me an interrupt 800uS later.  This will give a suitable blanking delay
 
 at 2' and .5" I saw a delay of 3.68mS from the end of firing to a return...With 22.5" I saw3.32mS....17.5" gave 2.56mS

            Once here, I need to check if the pin is already receiving something and if so, return with minimum(4"???) delay.
        If I'm not already receiving anything, call 'kickTheCan' to start the timer. This will limit how long I'll be able to
        listen (via ISR) and also I can check the value of TCNT1 when the receiver does getsomething, and this will be the manner to determine distance
