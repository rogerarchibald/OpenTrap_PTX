 There is already a lot happening in Timers and so I'll put everything here that's specific to the Ultrasonic RangeFinder.  The Flow is as follows:

    - At the start of Main.c prior to the infinite loop, I'll call prep4Fire which will set up Timer1 to be ready to go.
    
    - 25mS into my 50mS loop, timers.c will call 'enableNoise' which will enable the ouptut and turn on the timer, pulsing the Xducer for ~200uS.  After it's done pulsing, I'll call 'kickTheCan(25) which will give me an interrupt 800uS later.  This will give a suitable blanking delay
 
    -State Machine has 4 states:
        -Prepped for Fire: No Timer running, timer is set up to generate firing pulses but no clock is enabled
        -MakeNoise: Firing transducer for ~200uS
        -deadTime: An 800uS delay where I'm allowing any direct-coupled signal to subside before listening for a return
        -listenMode: Here I'll arm INT0 and listen.  From here I'm going to get an interrupt: either INT0 when something bounces back, or Timer1Overflow if the signal is blocked.
 
    Numbers to remember: 148uS/inch is sonic speed.  When I'm running kickTheCan my timer resolution is 32uS (8Mhz clock with a /256 prescaler
